## üöÄ Getting Started

These projects require Python 3.8 or above and the following libraries :

* PyTorch
* OpenCV
* torchvision
* numpy, scipy, matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* WandB (for experiment logging)
* ultralytics (YOLOv8)
* transformers (for CLIP/BLIP)
* open3d (for point cloud registration)

* **Focus:** Label smoothing, Gaussian cross-entropy, dilated convolutions, CNN classifiers, segmentation, detection, multi-object tracking.
* **Deliverables:** Theory derivations, CNN training from scratch, fine‚Äëtuning ResNet‚Äë18, SegNet & DeepLabV3 segmentation, YOLOv8 detection & TIDE analysis, MOT17 tracking.

### **2. Camera and Panorama**

* **Focus:** 3D transformations, camera calibration, panorama stitching, point cloud registration.
* **Deliverables:** Coordinate transforms & Rodrigues‚Äô formula, homography & intrinsic/extrinsic estimation, chessboard calibration & reprojection error, SIFT-based stitching, ICP LiDAR registration.

### **3. Vision Language Models**

* **Focus:** CLIP & CLIPS zero‚Äëshot evaluation, BLIP visual question answering & captioning, referring image segmentation (LAVT & Matcher).
* **Deliverables:** Similarity comparisons, VQA answers, caption quality metrics, RIS & one‚Äëshot segmentation demos.

### **4. Generative and Segmentation**

* **Focus:** GAN theory & DCGAN/StyleGAN3 implementation, advanced segmentation tasks.
* **Deliverables:** GAN proofs, DCGAN & StyleGAN3 code (latent interpolation, style mixing, fine‚Äëtuning on custom data), segmentation experiments.
